    "# Planetary Arrival: Flyby\n",
    "\n",
    "As we discussed in the [last section](./planetary-arrival-capture.md), the options that a spacecraft has when arriving at a planet are to impact the planet, enter a capture orbit, or do a flyby to change its heliocentric velocity vector. In this section, we'll consider the case of a flyby of the arrival planet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin with a few definitions. All capital letters will refer to heliocentric velocities, while lower case letters refer to geocentric velocities. Furthermore, the superscript $s$ will refer to the spacecraft, while variables with no superscript refer to the planet. Finally, subscript 1 refers to the arrival point at the sphere of influence and subscript 2 refers to the departure point from the sphere of influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal in this analysis is to determine the heliocentric velocity vector when the spacecraft exits the sphere of influence, $\\vector{V}_2^s$. This vector is then used to determine the orbital elements of the spacecraft's modified heliocentric orbit.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the departure velocity vector, we will treat the arrival and departure events independently. We will also remove the assumption that $v_{\\infty}$ be parallel to the planet's heliocentric velocity vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Arrival Trajectory\n",
    "\n",
    "When the spacecraft arrives at the target planet, it's trajectory will be a hyperbola relative to the planet. When crossing the sphere of influence of the planet, the spacecraft can be in one of two orientations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. crossing in front of the planet, as shown in {numref}`fig:interplanetary-leading-flyby`, called a **leading-side flyby**.\n",
    "\n",
    "   :::{figure} ../images/interplanetary-leading-flyby.svg\n",
    "   :name: fig:interplanetary-leading-flyby\n",
    "\n",
    "   A leading-side planetary flyby. Notice that the spacecraft crosses in front of the planet along the planet's direction of motion.\n",
    "   :::\n",
    "\n",
    "2. crossing behind the planet, as shown in {numref}`fig:interplanetary-trailing-flyby`, called a **trailing-side flyby**\n",
    "\n",
    "   :::{figure} ../images/interplanetary-trailing-flyby.svg\n",
    "   :name: fig:interplanetary-trailing-flyby\n",
    "\n",
    "   A trailing-side planetary flyby. Notice that the spacecraft crosses behind the planet along the planet's direction of motion.\n",
    "   :::\n",
    "\n",
    "The angle $\\delta$, given by Eq. {eq}`eq:hyperbolic-turn-angle`, is the turn angle. Note that $\\delta$ is positive counterclockwise, so it is negative for the trailing-side flyby.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Arrival Heliocentric Velocity\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the spacecraft's hyperbolic orbital elements, we need to find $\\vector{v}_{\\infty,1}$, the excess velocity vector at arrival. The excess velocity vector can be found by taking the vector difference of the planet and spacecraft heliocentric velocity vectors:\n",

    "where $e_1$, $h_1$, and $\\nu_1$ are the eccentricity, angular momentum, and true anomaly, respectively, of the heliocentric transfer orbit.\n",

    "### Geocentric Unit Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify the calculation of $\\vector{v}_{\\infty}$, we would like to work with unit vectors attached to the planet, rather than the sun. The $\\uvec{u}_r$-$\\uvec{u}_{\\perp}$ coordinate system, which is attached to the heliocentric orbit, can be converted into a geocentric system with the unit vectors $\\uvec{u}_{V}$ and $\\uvec{u}_{S}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\uvec{u}_V$ points along the planet's orbital velocity vector. Since we assumed that the planet's orbit is circular, the planet's orbital velocity vector is always perpendicular to it's radial vector. In other words:\n",

    "The magnitude of the excess velocity depends only on the semimajor axis of the hyperbola. Since the semimajor axis is constant, the magnitude of the excess velocity is also constant. Thus, we drop the subscript for arrival and departure for the magntiude.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have the magnitude of the excess velocity, and when we specify a value for $r_p$, we can apply the techniques in the [previous section](./planetary-arrival-capture.md) to compute the orbital elements of the hyperbola.\n",

    "Now that we have $\\vector{v}_{\\infty,1}$ from Eq. {eq}`eq:interplanetary-flyby-excess-velocity-geocentric`, we are ready to calculate the departure trajectory. The $\\vector{v}_{\\infty}$ vector is rotated through the turn angle $\\delta$. We need a consistent reference line from which the angle of the $\\vector{v}_{\\infty}$ vector can be measured.\n",

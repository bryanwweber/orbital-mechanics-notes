    "# Planetary Arrival: Capture\n",
    "\n",
    "In an interplanetary transfer, when we arrive at the target planet, we have three choices of trajectory:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Impact the planet\n",
    "2. Go into orbit around the planet\n",
    "3. Flyby the planet, using the planet's angular momentum to change the spacecraft's heliocentric trajectory\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll talk about the first two options, and discuss flyby trajectories in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Arrival Trajectory\n",
    "\n",
    "When arriving at the target planet, the spacecraft will cross the sphere of influence *ahead of* or *behind* the planet on the planet's orbital path.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inner to Outer Planet**: The spacecraft velocity is lower than the planet's orbital velocity. The spacecraft crosses the sphere of influence *in front* of the planet. This is shown in {numref}`fig:interplanetary-arrival`.\n",

    "In {numref}`fig:interplanetary-arrival` and {numref}`fig:interplanetary-arrival-inward-transfer`, we see that the spacecraft crosses the sphere of influence at some **offset distance** or **aiming radius**, $y$, perpendicular to the planet's orbital path. The offset distance is determined by the desired periapsis radius of the arrival hyperbola, $r_p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Orbital Elements of Arrival Trajectory\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the [departure trajectory](./planetary-departure-trajectory.md), we must choose the value of $r_p$ that we want for the hyperbola. If we want to impact the planet, in the absence of an atomsphere, then we should choose the radius of the planet as $r_p$. If an atmosphere is present, then an altitude at the approximate edge of the atmosphere would be more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, we may want to enter an orbit around the planet, either to conduct a science mission or perform system checks before a deorbit burn. In this case, $r_p$ should be well above the atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "In either case, once $r_p$ is chosen, we can calculate the eccentricity of the arrival trajectory using Eq. {eq}`eq:interplanetary-hyperbola-eccentricity`:\n",

    "\n",
    "Depending on the mission design, we may want to impact the planetary atmosphere from the hyperbolic approach trajectory. In that case, the offset distance must be precisely determined so that the hyperbolic periapsis radius is within the atmosphere. There is a small range of values of the offset distance that will achieve this, depending on the height of the atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, since the plane of the hyperbolic arrival trajectory can be rotated around the center of the planet, there is a surface of possible arrival trajectories (much like the surface of departure trajectories). Combined with the range of offset distances, this gives a small annulus where the hyperbola will impact the atmosphere. This annulus is called the [**reentry corridor**](https://web.archive.org/web/20211115092141/https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/avs/offices/aam/cami/library/online_libraries/aerospace_medicine/tutorial/media/iii.4.1.7_returning_from_space.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "The size of the reentry corridor depends on:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the hyperbolic excess speed, which in turn depends on where the spacecraft is coming from\n",
    "- the height of the atmosphere of the planet\n",
    "- the gravitational parameter of the planet\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "To give an idea of the order of magnitude of the size of the reentry corridor, let's take the example of an Earth return trajectory from Mars. By convention, spacecraft enter Earth's atmosphere at the [**Kármán line**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_line), an imaginary line at an altitude of 100 km where the density of the atmosphere is signifcant. This gives $r_p$ values ranging from 6,378–6,478 km.\n",

    "Next, let's compute $v_{\\infty}$ for an arrival from Mars."

    "\n",
    "If the spacecraft is to impact the planet or its atmosphere, then we do not need to be worried about a $\\Delta v$ maneuver, in general. However, if the spacecraft will enter a capture orbit, then it must conduct a burn to change from the hyperbolic trajectory to a circular or elliptical orbit.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with other $\\Delta v$ calculations, we need to determine the velocity of the spacecraft on the initial trajectory, the hyperbola in this case, where it intersects with the capture orbit. We also need the velocity of the spacecraft on the capture orbit at the intersection point.\n",

    "### Capture Orbit\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the capture orbit, we need to decide on two factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Where in the capture orbit, relative to the capture orbit's periapsis, will the transfer occur\n",
    "2. The eccentricity of the capture orbit\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually we will assume that the transfer occurs at the periapsis of the capture orbit. This will give the minimum $\\Delta v$ requirement, since it is the point where the velocity is highest on the capture orbit, and therefore the place where the velocity on the capture orbit is closest to the hyperbolic velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, since the transfer must occur where the orbits intersect, the radial coordinate at the transfer point is $r_p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we need to choose a capture orbit eccentricity. The choice of eccentricity of the capture orbit depends on what your mission objectives are. If you are going into a capture orbit to conduct system checks followed by a landing mission, or if your mission is to study the planet with on-board instruments, you may want to choose an orbit with small eccentricity to maximize the time close to the planet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another option might include a mission that involves transfers to moons or other bodies in the planetary system. Then, a higher eccentricity orbit might be more appropriate. Finally, if the mission is constrained by the available propellant, then this might also dictate your choice of eccentricity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of how the eccentricity is determined, we can immediately state a few facts about the transfer:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The eccentricity must be between 0.0 and 1.0. If the eccentricity of the capture orbit is greater than or equal to 1.0, then it is not a capture orbit but a parabolic or hyperbolic escape trajectory.\n",
    "2. The highest $\\Delta v$ requirement is to enter a circular capture orbit. Intuitively, we expect that if the eccentricity does not change and the spacecraft does a hyperbolic flyby, the $\\Delta v$ is zero. Thus, larger eccentricity changes require larger $\\Delta v$. The largest possible eccentricity change is to reduce the eccentricity to zero, therefore requiring the largest $\\Delta v$, assuming that the transfer happens at periapsis of the capture orbit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the transfer point and eccentricity of the capture orbit are determined, we can use the methods from [](../the-orbit-equation/elliptical-orbits.md) to calculate the velocity at periapsis. One method would be to calculate the semimajor axis of the orbit:\n",

    "# Interplanetary Transfer Phasing\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from the $\\Delta v$ requirement discussed in the [previous section](./heliocentric-trajectories.md), the other important requirement for interplanetary trajectories is to correctly time the transfer so that the spacecraft and target planet rendezvous at arrival. Since the transfer orbits can take months or years to complete, the target planet may complete a significant fraction of its orbit during the transfer. Therefore, it is critical to launch the spacecraft at just the right time to rendezvous at arrival.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we did before, we will use the Hohmann transfer for simplicity. However, all the techniques discussed here can be applied to non-Hohmann transfers as well, as long as the total transfer time is known.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Planetary Phase Angles\n",
    "\n",
    "To correctly determine when a spacecraft should be launched, we need to know two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The total time of the transfer orbit\n",
    "2. The angular distance between two planets, relative to the Sun\n",
    "\n",
    "The first item can be determined from the orbital elements of the transfer orbit, so we will not discuss how to calculate it here. The second item, the angular distance between two planets, is commonly called the **phase angle**. This is the angle formed by drawing radii from the initial planet to the Sun and then to the final planet, as shown in {numref}`fig:interplanetary-phase-angle`.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{figure} ../images/interplanetary-phase-angle.svg\n",
    ":name: fig:interplanetary-phase-angle\n",
    ":width: 75%\n",
    "\n",
    "A hypothetical Hohmann transfer with increasing radius. The initial phase angle between the initial and final planets is $\\gamma_1$ and the phase angle after the transfer is complete is $\\gamma_2$. Note that while the spacecraft travels 180° of true anomaly on the transfer trajectory (green), the initial planet (blue) travels more than 180° and the final planet (red) travels less than 180°.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section, we assumed that the orbits of the planets are circular. This allows us to define the angluar distance traversed by the planet in a time interval by its average angular velocity, also called the _mean motion_:\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{math}\n",
    ":label: eq:mean-motion\n",
    "n = \\frac{2\\pi}{T}\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the mean motion, we can define the true anomaly of a planet at a given time $t$:\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{math}\n",
    ":label: eq:circle-planet-true-anomaly\n",
    "\\nu = \\nu_0 + n t\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\nu_0$ is the value of the true anomaly at $t = 0$. Applying this to the two planets in the transfer, we can write:\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{math}\n",
    ":label: eq:planetary-phase-angle\n",
    "\n",
    "\\gamma = \\nu_f - \\nu_i = \\gamma_0 + \\left(n_f - n_i\\right) t\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\gamma_0 = \\nu_{f,0} - \\nu_{i,0}$ is the phase angle at $t = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Synodic Period\n",
    "\n",
    "The question naturally arises, if the phase angle is $\\gamma_0$ at $t = 0$, how long does it take to become $\\gamma_0$ again? This length of time is called the **synodic period** of the two planets. Each pair of planets has its own synodic period, determined by the relative mean motions of the planets.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want the phase angle to change from $\\gamma_0$, through all the values, and come back to $\\gamma_0$, then the phase angle will have changed by 2𝜋 radians. If the initial planet has a smaller orbital radius, then the apparent motion is clockwise and the final phase angle is $\\gamma_0 - 2\\pi$. On the other hand, if the initial planet has a larger orbital radius, then the final phase angle will be $\\gamma_0 + 2\\pi$ because the apparent motion is counterclockwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "In either case, we can use Eq. {eq}`eq:planetary-phase-angle` to calculate the time it takes for the initial phase angle to reoccur:\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{math}\n",
    ":label: eq:synodic-period-1\n",
    "\\gamma_0 \\pm 2\\pi = \\gamma_0 + \\left(n_f - n_i\\right) T_{syn}\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "where $T_{syn}$ is the synodic period. Solving Eq. {eq}`eq:synodic-period-1` for $T_{syn}$ would result in two equations, depending on whether $n_f > n_i$ or vice versa. We can unify the equations by taking the absolute value of the difference $n_f - n_i$:\n",

    "T_{syn} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lvert n_f - n_i\\rvert}\n",
    ":::\n",

    "Finally, by plugging Eq. {eq}`eq:mean-motion` into Eq. {eq}`eq:synodic-period-2`, we can write the synodic period in terms of the planets' orbital periods, $T_i$ and $T_f$:\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{math}\n",

    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "The synodic period is the period of the orbit of one planet relative to another, rather than relative to the Sun.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phase Angle at Departure\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have enough information to determine the required phase angle at departure from the initial planet. Given the transfer trajectory, we can compute the transfer time, $t_{12}$. For a Hohmann transfer, this is given by Eq. {eq}`eq:hohmann-transfer-time`.\n",

Since Venus whips around the Sun, relative to Neptune, the same phase angle occurs relatively often."

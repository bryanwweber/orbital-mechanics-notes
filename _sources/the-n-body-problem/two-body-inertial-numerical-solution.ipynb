    "The system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in {eq}`eq:two-body-inertial-equation-of-motion` or {eq}`eq:two-body-inertial-components` is a second order system.

    "However, it would be inefficient to do this by hand and there are more accurate methods available. I don't see a reason to re-implement standard functions, so we are going to use the functions built-in to SciPy or Matlab, depending on which software you're using.\n",

    "Then, we need to define the function that describes the motion of our system. This function needs to compute the left hand side of the equation above ($\\dot{\\vector{y}}$) and return it to the solver, so that the solver can calculate the value of the state vector at time $t + \\Delta t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function takes the time $t$ and current value of the state vector $y$ as inputs. In this way, we can use the current state vector to compute the current acceleration.\n",

    "Inside the function, we use the values in the state vector to fill the `ydot` vector. Then, we return `ydot` back to the solver.\n",

    "With the function defined, we can call `solve_ivp()` or `ode45()`. We need to tell it the function it should solve, the beginning and end times, the initial state vector, and then some information to help control the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the solver finishes, the solution is stored in `sol.y` in Python or just `y` in Matlab. Each column of `sol.y` corresponds to a single timestep and each row corresponds to one of the state variables. It is more convenient to work with the transpose of this array, so we do that and define `y`. In Matlab, the solution already has each timestep in a row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we extract the position and velocity of each mass as a function of time, and compute the barycenter (the center of gravity of the system).\n",

Notice that the barycenter moves in a straight line. We will discuss this further in the [next section](./motion-of-the-barycenter.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "The two masses spiral around the barycenter. One way to imagine this system is as the Earth and the Moon viewed as though you were sitting on the Sun. The Earth and Moon would move through space, and they would appear to be orbiting around each other. If you observed them for a short enough time, their motion would appear to be in a straight line."

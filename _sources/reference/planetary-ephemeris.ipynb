    "# Planetary Ephemeris\n",
    "\n",
    "To design realistic interplanetary missions, we must be able to determine the state vector of the relevant planets at a given time, or over a given time interval. This allows calculation of, for instance, the phase angle between planets to determine the window of time to reach the target planet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data that gives the state vector are called _planetary ephemerides_. Due to the chaotic nature of the orbits of the planets, we can only accurately predict planetary state vectors for a relatively short time into the future, about 50--100 years. The chaotic nature of the orbits is due to the complex interaction of the orbits with the gravitational potential from the Sun and Jupiter, primarily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ephemerides are also available for more minor objects in the solar system, such as planetary moons and asteroids. The uncertainty over long time intervals of these objects is even higher than for planets, because more objects have the ability to change the orbit of the smaller bodies.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to calculate ephemerides. We will discuss three of them here:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using simplified formulas from JPL\n",
    "2. Using more accurate equations with a purpose-built library\n",
    "3. Using the online HORIZONS database\n",
    "\n",
    "In all three cases, we rely on knowing the [**Julian Day**](./julian-date.md) of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simplified Formulas for Ephemerides\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplified formulas for ephemerides from JPL are due to E.M. Standish, and are available from the [JPL website](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/approx_pos.html). The calculation procedure is further described in the accompanying [PDF document](https://web.archive.org/web/20210308074603/https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/txt/aprx_pos_planets.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplified formulas give the classical Keplerian orbital elements ($h$, $e$, $M$, $\\nu$, $\\Omega$, and $\\omega$) for each of the planets. Each element is given with its absolute value at a reference point in time, plus the rate of change of that element. The rates of change are all given _per century_, and the reference point is the [J2000.0 epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_(astronomy)#Julian_Dates_and_J2000) (January 1, 2000 at 12:00 PM (noon) UTC).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to determine the Julian Date given the Gregorian date and time, with the procedure described in the last section. With that completed, we will need to compute the number of Julian centuries that have elapsed since J2000.0 until the target date. We can do that by:\n",

    "\n",
    "where $\\mathrm{JDT}$ is the desired Julian Date. Note that this should be floating point division, not integer division.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we need to inspect the data. There are two tables given, one that is valid from AD 1800 to AD 1950, and the other that is valid from 3000 BC to AD 3000. The longer time range has a larger error relative to historical data.\n",

  abstract = {This paper represents a final report on the gravity analysis of radio Doppler and range data generated by the Deep Space Network (DSN) with Mariner 10 during two of its encounters with Mercury in March 1974 and March 1975. A combined least-squares fit to Doppler data from both encounters has resulted in a determination of two second degree gravity harmonics, J2 = (6.0 {$\pm$} 2.0) \texttimes{} 10-5 and C22 = (1.0 {$\pm$} 0.5) \texttimes{} 10-5, referred to an equatorial radius of 2439 km, plus an indication of a gravity anomaly in the region of closest approach of Mariner 10 to Mercury in March 1975 amounting to a mass deficiency of about GM = -0.1 km3sec-2. An analysis is included that defends the integrity of previously published values for the mass of Mercury (H. T. Howard et al. 1974, Science 185, 179\textendash 180; P. B. Esposito, J. D. Anderson, and A. T. Y. Ng 1978, COSPAR: Space Res. 17, 639\textendash 644). This is in response to a published suggestion by R. A. Lyttleton (1980, Q. J. R. Astron. Soc. 21, 400\textendash 413; 1981, Q. J. R. Astron. Soc. 22, 322\textendash 323) that the accepted values may be in error by more than 30\%. We conclude that there is no basis for being suspicious of the earlier determinations and obtain a mass GM = 22,032.09 {$\pm$} 0.91 km3sec-2 or a Sun to Mercury mass ratio of 6,023,600 {$\pm$} 250. The corresponding mean density of Mercury is 5.43 {$\pm$} 0.01 g cm-3. The one-sigma error limits on the gravity results include an assessment of systematic error, including the possibility that harmonics other than J2and C22 are significantly different from zero. A discussion of the utility of the DSN radio range data obtained with Mariner 10 is included. These data are most applicable to the improvement of the ephemeris of Mercury, in particular the determination of the precession of the perihelion.},

Completely revised and updated, this second edition takes into account new developments of the past four decades, especially regarding information technology. Central emphasis is placed on the use of the universal variable formulation, although classical methods are also discussed. The development of the basic two-body and n-body equations of motion serves as a foundation for all that follows. Subsequent topics include orbit determination and the classical orbital elements, coordinate transformations, and differential correction. The Kepler and Gauss problems are treated in detail, and two-body mechanics are applied to the ballistic missile problem. Perturbations, integration schemes and error, and analytic formulations of several common perturbations are introduced. Example problems and exercises appear throughout the text, along with photographs, diagrams, and drawings. Four helpful appendixes conclude the book"--},

With improvements in spatial coverage, force modeling, and data weighting, we refined an earlier global gravity field both in quality and resolution, and we present here a spherical harmonic solution to degree and order 50. In this field, termed HgM005, uncertainties in low-degree coefficients are reduced by an order of magnitude relative to earlier global fields, and we obtained a preliminary value of the tidal Love number k2 of 0.451 {$\pm$} 0.014. We also estimated Mercury's pole position, and we obtained an obliquity value of 2.06 {$\pm$} 0.16 arcmin, in good agreement with analysis of Earth-based radar observations. From our updated rotation period (58.646146 {$\pm$} 0.000011 days) and Mercury ephemeris, we verified experimentally the planet's 3:2 spin-orbit resonance to greater accuracy than previously possible. We present a detailed analysis of the HgM005 covariance matrix, and we describe some near-circular frozen orbits around Mercury that could be advantageous for future exploration.},

Compared to the previous general-purpose ephemerides DE430, seven years of new data have been added to compute DE440 and DE441, with improved dynamical models and data calibration. The orbit of Jupiter has improved substantially by fitting to the Juno radio range and Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) data of the Juno spacecraft. The orbit of Saturn has been improved by radio range and VLBA data of the Cassini spacecraft, with improved estimation of the spacecraft orbit. The orbit of Pluto has been improved from use of stellar occultation data reduced against the Gaia star catalog. The ephemerides DE440 and DE441 are fit to the same data set, but DE441 assumes no damping between the lunar liquid core and the solid mantle, which avoids a divergence when integrated backward in time. Therefore, DE441 is less accurate than DE440 for the current century, but covers a much longer duration of years -13,200 to +17,191, compared to DE440 covering years 1550\textendash 2650.},

Being transcendental, the equation cannot be directly solved for eccentric anomaly by conventional treatments; much work has been devoted to approximate methods. Here, we give an explicit integral solution, utilizing methods recently applied to the 'geometric goat problem' and to the dynamics of spherical collapse. The solution is given as a ratio of contour integrals; these can be efficiently computed via numerical integration for arbitrary eccentricities. The method is found to be highly accurate in practice, with our C++ implementation outperforming conventional root-finding and series approaches by a factor greater than two.},

  abstract = {The Cassini spacecraft has been operating in orbit around Saturn since 2004, during which time it has executed over 150 satellite encounters. Over this period, there have been several papers describing the orbit determination process and performance up through 2016 [1-5]. In April of 2017, Cassini will enter its Grand Finale mission phase when it will traverse the gap between the D-ring and the Saturn atmosphere twenty-two times before plunging deep into the atmosphere to end the mission. The lack of targeted satellite encounters during this period necessitates updates to the nominal Cassini Orbit Determination (OD) process. This paper describes these planned adaptations for the operation of the Grand Finale. During the Equinox and Solstice Mission Phase (2008-2016), navigation analysis has been divided into segments focused on two particular targeted satellite encounters, called an ``arc''. Maneuvers in an arc were usually targeted to encounter B-plane position and time, so the OD state and covariance were mapped forward to the B-plane of the encounter within the arc. Trajectory dispersions during the Grand Finale need instead to be mapped to equator crossings and targeted Cartesian positions. In addition, trajectory arcs have typically covered a few orbital revolutions (\textasciitilde 2-8 weeks), in order to span the time between two encounters. However, the Grand Finale will encompass five months of time without an encounter which necessitates an adjusted arc strategy. A modified arc strategy was developed based on OD behavior during long multi-rev periods between encounters in the year leading up to the Grand Finale. The OD covariance study conducted for the Grand Finale mission phase will also be examined.},

# Install/Build the Book

The repo is set up to use [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev) to install required tools. Once `mise` is installed, changing into this directory should install the correct tools with the right versions.

After that, running `pdm install` should install the dependencies. Then `doit build_jb` will build the book.
